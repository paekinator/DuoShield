# üöÄ Add Real 3D Models - Quick Start Guide

## Current Status
The code is **ready to load 3D models** in multiple formats! It will automatically:
- ‚úÖ Try to load models from `/public/models/` (GLB, GLTF, or OBJ)
- ‚úÖ Fall back to procedural models if files don't exist
- ‚úÖ Display console messages about what's loaded

## Supported Formats
- **GLB** (recommended) - Binary, single file, fastest
- **GLTF** - JSON format, may have separate files
- **OBJ** - Wavefront format, widely supported

The code will automatically try all formats for each model!

## How to Add Real Models (3 Easy Steps)

### Step 1: Download Free Models

Visit these sites and download **GLB** or **GLTF** format:

#### Option A: Sketchfab (Recommended - Easiest)
1. Go to https://sketchfab.com
2. Search for:
   - "International Space Station" 
   - "Satellite"
   - "CubeSat"
3. Filter by "Downloadable" and look for free models
4. Click Download ‚Üí Select "glTF Binary (.glb)"

#### Option B: NASA Official Models
1. Visit https://nasa3d.arc.nasa.gov/
2. Search "ISS" or "satellite"
3. Download in GLB format

#### Option C: Poly Pizza (Quick & Free)
1. Go to https://poly.pizza/
2. Search "satellite" or "space"
3. Download GLB files

### Step 2: Rename and Place Files

Put downloaded models in `/public/models/` with these names:

**Option 1 - GLB (recommended):**
- `iss.glb` - Your space station model
- `satellite1.glb` - First satellite type
- `satellite2.glb` - Second satellite type  
- `satellite3.glb` - Third satellite type

**Option 2 - OBJ:**
- `iss.obj` - Your space station model
- `satellite1.obj` - First satellite type
- `satellite2.obj` - Second satellite type  
- `satellite3.obj` - Third satellite type

**Option 3 - GLTF:**
- `iss.gltf` - Your space station model
- `satellite1.gltf` - First satellite type
- `satellite2.gltf` - Second satellite type  
- `satellite3.gltf` - Third satellite type

**Note:** The code tries all formats automatically, so you can mix and match!

### Step 3: Reload the Page

That's it! The code will automatically load your models.

## Specific Model Recommendations

### For ISS:
- **Sketchfab**: Search "ISS low poly" for performant models
- **Example**: https://skfb.ly/6YvXH

### For Satellites:
- **CubeSat**: Search "cubesat free download"
- **GPS Satellite**: Search "satellite communication"
- **Weather Satellite**: Search "weather satellite model"

## Testing

Open your browser console (F12) and you'll see messages like:
```
‚úÖ ISS model loaded successfully
‚úÖ Satellite 1 loaded from /models/satellite1.glb
```

Or if models aren't found:
```
‚ÑπÔ∏è ISS model not found, using procedural model
```

## File Size Tips
- Keep models under 2MB each for fast loading
- Look for "low poly" models
- GLB format is smaller than GLTF

## Current Fallback
Right now, you're seeing **procedural models** (code-generated).
Once you add GLB files, they'll automatically replace these!

## Need Help?
The procedural models work fine as placeholders.  You can add real models anytime!
